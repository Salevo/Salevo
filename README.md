## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸŒ±  ABOUT ME

I'm an experienced senior marketing manager specialized in building affiliate & influencer programs and vibrant communities around the product on all major social media platforms as well as creatively developing campaigns and strategies that tie together the brands story and voice over different marketing channels. 

Now I'm passionately learning data analytics in order to understand data better and be able to make connections and find recommendations I wasn't able to find before. I just finished a Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack spanning skills like Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn), Inferential Statistics & predictive modeling, MySQL, Data wrangling & analyzing, Web/API scraping, data visualisation (Tableau, Plotly, Seaborn) and Machine Learning.

I hope to further find a job in marketing data analytics to combine my knowledge and newfound passion.

### ðŸ’š  PROJECTS I'M PROUD OF

ðŸ’¡ [Google Play Store Analysis](https://github.com/Salevo/Google-Play-Store-Analysis): Using machine learning I tested if it is possible to predict an Apps' ranking on the Google Play Store with the data available on it. Further I used review sentiment analysis to determine the pain points of users with an app.

ðŸ’¡ [Music Recommendation App](https://github.com/Salevo/Gnoosic-music-recommendation-app): Using web-scraping and the Spotipy-API to train a machine learning algorithm to be able to give valuable music recommendations upon user input of a song they already know and like.

ðŸ’¡ [User Data Analysis](https://github.com/Salevo/User-Data-Analysis): Analysing user data of an app in order to determine technical and advertising recommendations for the company. Using clustering techniques to figure out if the user-base is the desired one. (Due to data privacy, data and code is not included, the results however can be seen in the final presentation).
